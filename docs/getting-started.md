# Getting Started

Follow these steps to go from signup to your first Autopilot campaign.

## 1. Create your workspace

1. Visit [tradebacklinks.com](https://www.tradebacklinks.com) and start the free trial.
2. Confirm your email address.
3. Provide your primary domain and company name so the system can personalize outreach copy.

## 2. Seed keywords and competitors

1. Enter the keywords you want to rank for (e.g., `no code developers`).
2. Add 2–3 similar but not closely competing domains. TradeBacklinks uses this to source matching opportunities.
3. Wait a few minutes while opportunities are fetched in the background.
