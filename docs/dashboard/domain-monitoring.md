# Domain Monitoring

Keep tabs on backlinks you already have and catch issues before rankings dip.

## Top metrics
- **Domain Health Rating** – Letter grade summarizing backlink mix and spam risk.
- **Your Domain Rating** – Current authority score with a manual refresh button.
- **Domain Spam Score** – Alerts you to toxic backlinks or suspicious domains pointing your way.

## Tabs
1. **Your Backlinks** – Verified links pointing to your site. Columns include source URL, destination path, estimated traffic, and anchor text.
2. **Broken Links** – Links that disappeared, return 404/500, or were switched to nofollow. Use this list to trigger reactivation campaigns.

## Recommended actions
- Sort by "Created Date" to ensure new backlinks are reviewed quickly.
- Use the anchor text column to maintain a healthy mix (brand, keyword, generic).
- When a spammy domain appears, add it to your disavow plan or exclude it in the Compensation tab.
