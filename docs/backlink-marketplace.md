Browse publishers already open to collaborations. This is a supplement to Autopilot: when you need a quick win, request a placement here.

## Listings table
- **Name** – Domain you’ll partner with.
- **Category** – Blog, SaaS, marketplace, directory, etc.
- **Cost** – Shows whether the listing is free or paid.
- **Domain Authority** – Gauge the value of the link.
- **Request button** – Opens a lightweight contact form so you can pitch immediately.

## Tips
- Sort by category to find niche matches.
- Paid listings often respond faster; free listings are better for stretching credits.
- After a deal is live, log it under Compensation Plan so your metrics stay accurate.
