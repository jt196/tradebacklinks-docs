Tell Autopilot what you’re willing to offer in exchange for backlinks.

## Active option
- The top card shows the currently active offer (e.g., "Exchange backlinks – Swap relevant links to provide mutual value").
- Use the up/down arrows to reorder offers. Autopilot always leads with Step 1.
- Toggle the switch to disable an offer temporarily.
- Customize the pitch copy so it matches your brand voice.

## Not Active section
Choose from presets like:
1. Write a guest post.
2. Provide a product demo.
3. Promote partner content on your channels.
4. Offer discounts/perks.
5. Affiliate program membership.
6. Testimonials, etc.

You can enable multiple steps (e.g., start with a swap, fall back to a testimonial). Autopilot will escalate automatically if a partner declines the first offer.

**Tip:** Revisit this page after major launches. New perks or assets (case studies, templates) can sweeten deals.
