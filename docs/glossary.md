# Glossary

- **Autopilot** – TradeBacklinks' daily outreach engine. It selects the next best domains, sends emails from your connected inboxes, and updates statuses automatically.
- **Compensation credit** – Internal currency used to value link swaps, guest posts, or cash payouts. Credits help Autopilot negotiate consistently.
- **DR / Domain Rating** – Authority score similar to Ahrefs' DR, surfaced via the SEO Traffic & Authority API. Higher DR = stronger backlink influence.
- **UR / URL Rating** – Page-level strength metric used to evaluate specific URLs when prioritizing outreach.
- **Spam Score** – Risk indicator from Wobado/Domain Metrics APIs. High scores suggest a domain could hurt your SEO.
- **SimilarWeb Traffic** – Monthly visit estimates that appear in the Opportunity table. Helps gauge whether a backlink drives referral traffic as well as authority.
- **DataForSEO Broken-link check** – Crawl that monitors whether previously won links still exist or whether partner pages return errors.
- **Unsubscribe flag** – Boolean field stored per contact or domain. When true, Autopilot will exclude the lead from future emails.
- **Inbox rotation** – Practice of spreading outreach volume across multiple sending mailboxes to maintain deliverability.
- **Opportunity** – A domain + placement idea generated from your keywords/competitors. Each opportunity flows through statuses such as Queued, Contacted, Negotiating, Won, or Lost.
